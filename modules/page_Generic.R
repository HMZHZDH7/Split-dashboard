#The structure for generic pages, since most normal tabs will look similar it's easier to just have a generic page module.
#If further down the line each tab needs to be individually customisable then each tab will need its own module for its tailored structure
#Note that this module takes as a parameter the tab name, this is to be able to filter from the QI list which QI's belong to each tab.
